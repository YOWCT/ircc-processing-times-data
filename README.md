# Data repository for IRCC processing times (ircc-processing-times-data)

This repository examines IRCC visa and immigration processing times from the [Check application processing times](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/times/) website.

It will include raw data scraped from the [pt-messages.js file](http://www.cic.gc.ca/js/tools/processing-times/pt-messages.js) which includes the wait time (in weeks) by country. This will be analyzed over time in a separate repository.

This repository is meant as an archive of changes in the processing times messages file, and will likely be updated automatically in the future.
